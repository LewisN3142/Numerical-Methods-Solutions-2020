# Numerical-Methods-Solutions-2020

A collection of sample solutions for the University of Surrey mathematics module Numerical and Computational Methods from academic year 2020/21, programmed in MATLAB.
The module page can be found [here](https://catalogue.surrey.ac.uk/2020-1/module/MAT2001), but in brief, the course covered methods of solving systems of linear and differential equations, finding interpolating functions, approximating derivatives, and complexity of algorithms.
PDFs of the exercises and mathematical components of their solutions are also included here and on [my website](https://lewisn3142.github.io/code_page/code_catalogue.html)
These exercises were created in collaboration with the class lecturer Stefan Klus as part of my role as computer lab support and were delivered to second year undergraduate classes.
