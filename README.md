# Numerical-Methods-Solutions-2020
A collection of sample solutions for the University of Surrey mathematics module Numerical and Computational Methods. The corresponding exercise and solution sheets can be found on [my website](https://lewisn3142.github.io/code_page/code_catalogue.html). These exercises were created in collaboration with the class lecturer Stefan Klus as part of my role as computer lab support and were delivered to second year undergraduate classes in the year 2020/21.
